"""Backup helpers: one shared tar routine + a scheduled auto-backup safety net.

A daily driver that runs for weeks needs a backup it never has to remember to
take. :func:`create_backup` is the shared archive routine (used by the
``ironjarvis backup`` CLI and the daemon's periodic loop); :func:`run_auto_backup`
writes a timestamped snapshot under ``<home>/backups`` and prunes old ones.
