"""Filesystem directory-browser backend (dashboard directory-tree panel).

A small, self-contained, on-demand directory lister that powers the tree panel
beside the terminals: the user browses the computer's folders one level at a
time and picks a project directory to use as a terminal's cwd.

Independent of the file-search subsystem on purpose (no shared imports).
