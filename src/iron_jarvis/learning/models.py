"""Learning persistence models — the durable substrate of the self-correcting loop.

Two SQLModel tables (auto-created via ``init_db`` once imported, §22):

* :class:`FeedbackRecord` — a thumbs up/down (+ optional comment) the user left on
  a past session. The raw signal.
* :class:`LessonRecord` — a distilled, reusable instruction ("lesson") the agent
  carries forward. Lessons are what get injected into every future system prompt,
  so the agent self-corrects and feels like it remembers how you work.

A lesson's ``weight`` and ``source`` decide injection priority: higher weight and
``preference``/``feedback`` sources are surfaced first.
