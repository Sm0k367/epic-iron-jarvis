"""Self-diagnostic ("doctor") for Iron Jarvis.

A SAFE, read-only health check anyone can run from zero to confirm their machine
can get value out of Iron Jarvis. No check ever raises; each returns a human
``detail`` and an actionable ``fix`` hint. *Required* checks gate the overall
``ok`` (these are what the install itself needs); *recommended* checks — the web
dashboard and voice/browser tooling — only warn so a minimal Python+uv install
still reports healthy.
