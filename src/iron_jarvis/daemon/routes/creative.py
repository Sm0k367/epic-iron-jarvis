#: Per-CLI "run without permission prompts" LAUNCH FLAGS for studio autopilot.
#: Claude uses --dangerously-skip-permissions: on current Claude Code, Shift+Tab
#: only cycles normal → accept-edits → plan → normal, and "accept edits" STILL
#: prompts on every shell command (python/ffmpeg/curl — exactly what media skills
#: run), so cycling could never reach a truly hands-off mode and a generation
#: stalled at the first command prompt (the "stuck, go to Build" failure). The
#: flag launches Claude genuinely hands-off from boot; its one-time acceptance
#: screen is auto-answered by _engage_claude_automode. It's opt-in (the autopilot
#: toggle) and scoped to the studio's chosen folder.
_AUTOPILOT_FLAGS = {
    "codex": "--full-auto",
    "claude": "--dangerously-skip-permissions",

#: mode. The current cycle is: manual → accept-edits → plan → auto → manual.
_SHIFT_TAB = "\x1b[Z"

#: Bracketed-paste markers (DECSET 2004). Wrapping a brief in these tells the TUI
#: "everything between is ONE literal paste" — so a long brief lands intact and no
#: interior byte (or a following Enter) can split it into an orphan fragment. A
#: TUI that supports pasting large text (Claude Code does) enables this mode while
#: its composer is active, which is the only time the studio sends.

#: Permission-mode banners Claude Code paints (ANSI already stripped by
#: output_tail). CURRENT strings first, older aliases kept so a machine on an
#: earlier Claude still works. Longer alternatives precede their prefixes so the
#: regex prefers "auto-accept edits on" over the "accept edits on" inside it.

#: TRULY hands-off modes — the CLI runs file edits AND shell commands without
#: ever stopping to ask. Media skills run commands (python, ffmpeg, curl), so
#: the studio must reach one of these or a generation stalls at the first
#: command prompt. "accept edits on" is deliberately EXCLUDED: it auto-accepts
#: edits but still prompts on every command (live-hit 2026-07-07 — a PowerShell
#: write blocked on "Do you want to proceed?"). "plan"/"manual" also excluded.
