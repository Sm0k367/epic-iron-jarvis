"""Skills Framework (§23).

Skills are reusable instruction bundles (instructions + optional examples,
scripts, templates, documents, workflows). They live at
``.ironjarvis/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` and are loaded into a :class:`SkillRegistry`
that the orchestrator can search and inject into an agent's system prompt.
