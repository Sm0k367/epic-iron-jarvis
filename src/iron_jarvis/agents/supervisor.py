"""Supervisor agent (§12 Multi-Agent Orchestration).

The Supervisor decomposes a task into subtasks and delegates each to a subagent
via the ``delegate`` tool. Subagents run with isolated context and return only
SUMMARIZED results; the supervisor is the single point of contact and produces
the final summary. Subagents never talk to the user directly.
