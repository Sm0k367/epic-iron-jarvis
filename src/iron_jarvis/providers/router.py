"""Model Router (§6).

Selects a ``(provider, model)`` for a request from policy/availability and
executes the completion. Fails over to the offline ``mock`` provider when the
requested provider is unavailable or errors, emitting ``provider.failed`` (§31).

Reliability spine (best-in-class routing):

* **Typed classification** — :func:`is_transient_error` decides transient-vs-
  permanent by exception TYPE + HTTP status (via :class:`ProviderError`), not by
  substring-matching an error body (which false-positives on token counts/ids).
* **Capability-aware routing** — a tool-using request never lands on a text-only
  adapter (e.g. codex-cli) that would silently return ``tool_calls=[]`` and stall
  the agent loop; images prefer a vision-capable adapter.
* **Circuit breaker** — a provider that fails N times in a row is skipped for a
  short cooldown (half-open probe after), so a dead provider stops absorbing
  latency on every request.
* **Failover** — a transient primary failure fans out across the OTHER connected
  providers (CLI-first arbitrage), deduped by resolved-adapter IDENTITY so the
  inherited alias (anthropic→claude-cli) isn't retried twice.
