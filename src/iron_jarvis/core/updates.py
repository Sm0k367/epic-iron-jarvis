"""Repo-based self-update (git).

Iron Jarvis runs from its OWN git checkout (uv + npm). This module lets a user
check for, and apply, updates that were pushed to the repo — pull the new source
(``git pull --ff-only``), re-sync Python deps (``uv sync``) and rebuild the
dashboard (``npm install && npm run build``).

Everything is dependency-injected: each git/build command goes through a
``runner`` callable that defaults to :data:`_subprocess_runner`. Tests inject a
fake runner, so the whole surface is exercisable offline with no real git or
network. :func:`update_status` never raises — on any error it returns a
``{available: False, reason: ...}`` descriptor.

CAVEAT — "the daemon updating its own running code": pulling new files on disk
does NOT reload the already-imported Python (or the dashboard bundle the browser
loaded). Every apply therefore reports ``restart_required: True``; the caller
(CLI/dashboard) tells the user to restart the daemon (and dashboard) so the new
code is actually loaded.
