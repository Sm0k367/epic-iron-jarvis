"""Event Bus (§31).

In-process async pub/sub. The single coordination point for the platform:
the agent runtime, tools, and providers publish; observability/persistence
(sync handlers) and the dashboard WebSocket (async subscribers) consume.

Redis Streams / NATS adapters are a later concern — this interface is what they
would implement.
