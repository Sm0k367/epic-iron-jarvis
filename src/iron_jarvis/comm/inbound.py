"""Two-way comm: the durable inbound poller (remote command surface).

The notifier's channels only PUSH out. :class:`InboundPoller` adds the receive
leg: it long-polls every channel whose inbound is *explicitly* enabled, and for
each AUTHORIZED message spawns a normal supervised session via the orchestrator,
awaits it, and replies the summary back over the same channel.

SECURITY (this drives the machine from a phone, so it is hardened by design):

* OFF BY DEFAULT / OPT-IN — :meth:`enabled` is True only when at least one
  channel has ``inbound_enabled = true`` *and* its credentials resolve. With no
  channels configured (the default + the test suite) the daemon never creates
  the loop: zero polling, zero network.
* SENDER ALLOWLIST, FAIL-CLOSED — a message is processed only when
  ``channel.is_authorized(sender_id)`` (an empty/missing allowlist authorizes
  nobody). An unauthorized sender NEVER spawns a session.
* NORMAL GATES — sessions run through the same orchestrator + permission engine
  as a local user, so a remote sender gets no extra power (dangerous tools still
  fail-closed under the headless ask-resolver).
* LOOP PROTECTION — the bot's own / other bots' messages are ignored.
* DURABLE OFFSET — the last-seen offset is persisted per channel so a restart
  resumes without reprocessing.

Mirrors the daemon's auto-backup / autonomy loops: the loop body sleeps, never
blocks boot, and is cancelled on shutdown.
