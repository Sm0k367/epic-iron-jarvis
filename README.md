# ⚡ IRON JARVIS

### Your own local-first AI operating system.

**Agents that plan, build, review, schedule, remember, and wire themselves into your world — running on *your* machine, under *your* control.**

No cloud lock-in. No black boxes. Every action logged, every change reviewable, every secret encrypted on your disk.

</div>

---

> **TL;DR** — Iron Jarvis turns a fleet of AI agents into a real operating system: a supervisor delegates to specialist subagents, work runs in sandboxed git worktrees you approve before merge, a layered memory + long-term knowledge base keeps context, and a beautiful Next.js control center (with an **n8n-style workflow canvas** and **voice-to-text**) lets you drive it all. Runs **fully offline** with a deterministic mock model — bring your own Claude key when you want the real thing.

## 🔥 Why Iron Jarvis

You've used AI chat. This is the next thing: **AI that does the work and shows you exactly what it did.**

- **It's an OS, not a chatbot.** A Supervisor decomposes your goal, spins up specialist subagents (Planner, Builder, Reviewer, Researcher…), and each works in an isolated, disposable workspace.
- **You stay in control.** Every tool call passes a **fail-closed permission engine**. Risky actions ask first. Code changes land on a git branch and **never auto-merge** — you review the diff and approve.
- **It remembers.** Four-layer memory (session → project → user → org) plus pluggable **long-term memory** (Obsidian, Notion, or any markdown "brain").
- **It plugs into your world.** Encrypted secrets vault, integrations, Slack/Telegram/Discord alerts, inbound + outbound webhooks, cron-scheduled tasks, cross-drive file search.
- **Agents extend themselves.** They can create new agents, schedule their own jobs, add webhooks, write to long-term memory, and **build workflows you then see and edit on a visual canvas.**
- **Local-first & private.** SQLite by default, secrets encrypted at rest, sandboxed execution. The network is optional.

## ✨ Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Multi-agent orchestration** | Supervisor → subagents, isolated context, summarized results |
| 🔒 **Fail-closed permissions** | allow / ask / deny on every tool; `shell` stays locked down |
| 🌳 **Git-native sessions** | branch → work → diff → **you approve** → merge (no auto-merge) |
| 🧩 **n8n-style workflows** | drag step-nodes, wire them, run the graph — agents can build them too |
| 🎙️ **Voice-to-text** | hit the mic and dictate a prompt (local browser speech) |
| 🗝️ **Encrypted secrets vault** | API keys / OAuth / tokens, shared by every subsystem, never shown to agents |
| 📅 **Scheduled tasks** | friendly repeat presets or a specific date/time — no cron syntax required |
| 🔭 **Observability** | live event stream, traces, per-run evaluation metrics |
| 🖥️ **Beautiful dashboard** | arc-reactor dark UI, Kanban board, real-time everything |
| 📄 **Every file type** | read & write **PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV, Markdown, text** — like a colleague would |
| 🌱 **Self-correcting** | feedback → lessons injected into every future run; it gets **better each time** you use it |
| 🔌 **Connect a model in seconds** | a Connections page with API-key or **OAuth 2.0 (PKCE)** sign-in — paste a key or click Connect |
| ✅ **254 offline tests** | the whole platform runs green with no network and no API keys |

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 0. Check your machine is ready (Python/uv/Node/pnpm/git/browser)
uv run ironjarvis doctor

# 1. Install + (optional) try it offline, no keys
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ironjarvis demo        # offline end-to-end across every subsystem
uv run pytest -q              # the full offline test suite, all green

# 2. ONE command to run everything (daemon :8787 + dashboard :3000, opens your browser)
uv run ironjarvis up
```

First time only, build the dashboard once: `cd dashboard && pnpm install && pnpm build`. After that, `ironjarvis up` launches both. Prefer two terminals? `uv run ironjarvis serve` + `cd dashboard && pnpm start`.

That's it. Open the dashboard, hit **New Session**, and watch agents work in real time.

**Connect a real model** — flawless and clear, right in the dashboard's **Connections** page (paste an API key or **Connect with OAuth**), or from the CLI:
```bash
uv run ironjarvis connect anthropic sk-ant-...   # stored encrypted in the vault
# the provider flips to "available" instantly — sessions route to it, no env vars
```

## 📖 Using Iron Jarvis — a practical guide

### Run a session (and dictate it 🎙️)
**Dashboard → Sessions → New session.** Type a task, or **click the mic and speak it** — your words transcribe straight into the prompt. Pick an agent type (`builder`, `supervisor`, …) and a provider, then **Run**. Watch the transcript, tool calls, and live events stream in. Or from the terminal:
```bash
uv run ironjarvis run "Summarize the quarterly financials and draft an email"
```

### Watch it on the Kanban board
**Dashboard → Kanban.** Sessions flow across **Active → In Review → Completed / Failed** lanes. For git-native sessions, **drag a card from In Review onto Completed to approve** (merge) or onto Failed to reject. Approve/Reject buttons are on each review card too.

### Build a workflow visually (n8n-style)
**Dashboard → Workflows.** Drag step-nodes onto the canvas, wire `Trigger → Gather → Draft → Review`, set each node's agent + task (mic included), and hit **Run workflow** — each step spawns a session. **Load** a saved workflow to edit it, **Save** your own. *Agents can create workflows here too — when one does, it appears on your canvas to inspect and manipulate.*

### Let agents extend themselves
Agents have self-service tools, so a single high-level task can ripple out:
- `schedule_create` — an agent schedules a recurring job for itself
- `webhook_add` — an agent wires an inbound/outbound webhook
- `ltm_append` / `ltm_search` — an agent writes to & queries long-term memory
- `file_search` — an agent searches across your drives
- `workflow_create` — an agent authors a workflow **you then see and edit visually**
- `create_agent` / `spawn_agent` — agents that add more agents

### Schedules (no cron required)
**Dashboard → Schedules.** Pick a **Repeat** preset (Hourly, Daily 9am, Weekdays 9am…) or choose **Once at a specific time** with a date picker. Each fire can run a workflow or emit an event.
```bash
uv run ironjarvis schedule-add nightly-books "0 2 * * *" --kind workflow
```

### Long-term memory (bring your own brain)
**Dashboard → Long-term Memory.** Search and append notes. **Add a custom source** — point it at an Obsidian vault / any markdown folder, or a Notion database (token from the vault). Custom sources show up in the search filter instantly.
```bash
uv run ironjarvis ltm-append "Client checklist" "EIN, prior returns, bank statements"
uv run ironjarvis ltm-search "onboarding"
```

### Secrets, integrations & channels
- **Secrets** — encrypted vault; values are write-only and never shown to agents or the UI.
- **Integrations** — enable / configure / **test** external services (each bound to a secret).
- **Channels** — connect Slack / Telegram / Discord; Iron Jarvis auto-alerts on review-requested, workflow-completed, and provider-failed events.

### Webhooks & file search
- **Webhooks** — **+ Add webhook** (inbound or outbound, HMAC-signed); inbound gives you a `POST /webhooks/{slug}` trigger URL.
- **File Search** — pick a **drive** (C:, D:, Home…) or a folder and search by name, content, or semantics.

> **CLI cheat sheet:** `init · serve · run · demo · metrics · evaluate · memory-search · ltm-search · ltm-append · file-search · schedule-add · schedules · secrets · integrations · agents · create-agent · notify · workflow · status`

## 🛡️ Security & privacy

- **Local-first.** All state lives under `.ironjarvis/` on your machine. The network is opt-in.
- **Fail-closed.** Unknown or unconfigured tool → denied. `shell` and other dangerous tools never auto-run headless.
- **Secrets encrypted at rest** (Fernet); agents can set/list names but **never read values**.
- **No auto-merge.** Agents stop at the diff; humans approve.
- **Sandboxed execution** with workspace-only filesystem, env scrubbing, timeouts (Docker or native).

---

## ✅ Proof it works

- **254 offline tests pass** (`uv run pytest -q`) — no network, no keys.
- Live daemon serves every endpoint; the dashboard has a clean production build.
- Real-Chrome screenshots of every page live in [`dashboard/proof/`](dashboard/proof/).
